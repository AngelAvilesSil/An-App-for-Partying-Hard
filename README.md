# An App for Partying Hard
My team and I worked on this Android application; we handled the team integration with this platform (GitHub).

## Some highlights
- The app's business logic is entirely written in JAVA.
- The layout and visuals are implemented in XML.
- Strings and values are set separately so anyone can translate the app easily into any language.
- Strongly focused on widget implementations, database handling and intercommunication with phone elements such as contact lists.
- It has some SQL elements handled through ROOM DAOs for efficiency.
- Implemented all features as fragments, so it is low-RAM friendly.

## How to run it
- Use Android Studio supporting Android Version 31 or higher.
- Download the repository and import it to your Android Studio.
- Please choose to download rather than clone. Android Studio does not behave well with GitHub, which might break the app. If cloning, use Android Studio Dolphin 2023.3.1.
- Compile and run; ensure the virtual device runs an Android version equal to or above 31.
